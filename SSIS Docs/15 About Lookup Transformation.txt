What Types Of Cahce Modes In Lookup
	We Have 3 Types
		A) No Cache
			When We Select Cahce Mode As NO CACHE , SSIS Lookup Component Should Not Use Any Cahce.
		B) Full Cahce
			When We Select Cahce Mode As Full Cache the Lookup Transforamtion Will Read All the Data Once From Source into Cahce, Then It Will Lookup Each Record Against ot Reference Table. If Matches Found for Those Records Will be Load to Lookup match OutPut and Non Match Recrods Will be Load to Lookup Non Match OutPut.
		C) Partial Cache
			When We Select the Cache Mode As Partial Cache then the Lookup Transformation Will Read Each Record from the Source Into Cache, Then It Will Lookup That Record from Source Against to Reference Table/Target Table/ Lookup Table.If Record Matches Found That Source Record Will be Cached for Further Use . After Load That Record to Lookup Match OutPut.
			
			When We Use Partial Cache, We Need to to Allocate the Cache Memory Size for Lookup Matching and Non Matching. The Memory Will be allocated to Cache from Your System Memory.
	If Your Dataset Size Is Small By the Time We Can Use Full Cahce Mode.
	If Your DataSet Size Is Huge By the Time We Can Use Partial Cache Mode.
