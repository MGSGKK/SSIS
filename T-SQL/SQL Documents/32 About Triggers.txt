--------------------------- Triggers--------------------------
	A trigger is a special kind of Stored Procedure or stored program that is automatically fired or executed when some event (insert, delete and update) occurs On Table.

	Use Cases:
		For Maintaining Auditing.
		For Maintaining Data Integrity.
	
	Magical Tables / Virtual Tables:
	If you write a trigger for an insert operation on a table, after firing the trigger, it creates a table named “INSERTED” in memory. Then it does the insert operation and then the statements inside the trigger executes. We can query the “INSERTED” table to manipulate or use the inserted row(s) from the trigger.
 
	Similarly, if you write a trigger for a delete operation on a table, it creates a table in memory named “DELETED” and then deletes the row.
	
	Types Of Triggers:
		1) After Trigger (using FOR/AFTER CLAUSE)
		2) Instead of Trigger (using INSTEAD OF CLAUSE)
		
	-- Create Triggers in SQL Server
	CREATE [OR ALTER] TRIGGER [Schema_Name].Trigger_Name
	ON Table
	AFTER INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE
	AS
	BEGIN
		-- Trigger Statements
		-- Insert, Update, Or Delete Statements 
	END
		
	-- Create Triggers in SQL Server
	CREATE [OR ALTER] TRIGGER [Schema_Name].Trigger_Name
	ON Table | View
	INSTEAD OF INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE
	AS
	BEGIN
