About Constraints In SQL Server?
	In SQL Server Constraint Is Nothing But a Condition Or a Businees Logic. These Constraints are Used to Maintain Data Integrity and We Can Impose these Constaints On Columns In a Table.In SQL Server We Have 7 Types Of Constraints.
	We Can Create These Constraints in 2 Ways
		1) While Creating Tables
		2) With Alter Statement
		
	1) NOT NULL
		If YOu Impose NOT NULL Constraint On Column , That Column Should Not Allow Null Values.
	2) UNIQUE
		If You Impose UNIQUE Constraint On Column , That Column It Should Allow One NUll Value and It Should Not Allow Duplicate Values In That Particular COlumn.
		It Should Create UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX. We Can Create Morethan One UNIQUE Constraints
	3) PRIMARY KEY
		Primary Can Be USed to Identify the Record As Uniuqe In Table.
		So This Primary Column It Should Not Allow Nulls And it Should Not Allow Duplicates.
		It Should Create UNIQUE CLUSTURED INDEX.Per One Table We Can Create Only One Primary Key.
	4) CHECK
		Check Constaints Can be Used to Put the Range And Conditions On Column.
	5) DEFAULT
		DEFAULT Constraint Can be Used to Assign the Default Values to the Columns.
	6) IDENTITY
		IDENTITY Constraint Is An Auto Increment Number. WHich Is Responseble For INcreasing Number.
		Syntax
			IDENTITY(Seed,Increment)
	7) FOREIGN KEY
		FOREIGN Key Can Be Used to Build the RealtionShip Between the Tables
		
		Referential Integrity
			Means Maintain the Relation Between Tables With Help of FOREIGN KEY
	
	1) The Reference Key In Parent Table It Should be either Primary Key Or UNIQUE Key
	
	
	Foreign Key Rules Or / Casceding Rules
		WHen You Perform DML(DELETE & UPDATE) Operations On Top Of Master/Parent Child Tables if they have Relations between the Tables By the Time These Casceding Rules We Can Use.
	We Have 4 Types Of Casceding/Foreign Key Rules
			A) NO Action (Default)
			B) CASCADE
			C) SET NULL
			D) SET DEFAULT
	NO ACTION:
		It Should Not Allow Any Update/Delete Operations
		
	CASCADE:
			For Update Associated values in child table would also be updated.
			For Delete Associated values in child table would also be Deleted.
	
	SET NULL:
		For Update Associated values in child table would be set to NULL. Foreign key column should allow NULL values to specify this rule.
		For Delete Associated values in child table would be set to NULL. Foreign key column should allow NULL values to specify this rule.
		
	SET DEFAULT:
		For Update Associated values in child table would be set to default value specified in column definition. Also default value should be present in primary key column. Otherwise basic requirement of FK relation would fail and update operation would not be successful. If no default value is provided in foreign key column this rule could not be implemented.
		
		For Delete Associated values in child table would be set to default value specified in column definition. Also default value should be present in primary key column. Otherwise basic requirement of FK relation would fail and delete operation would not be successful. If no default value is provided in foreign key column this rule could not be implemented.
		
	NOTE: If You Want to Perform DEFAULT That Foreign Key Column It Should Be Imposed by Default Constraint.
		
Syntax:
	ALTER TABLE TABLE_NAME
	ADD CONSTRINAT <Constrinat_Name> 
	<Constraint_Type>(<Column_Name>)
	REFERENCES <Parent_Table(<Column_Name>)>
	ON <Delete/Update> <CascadeRule>
