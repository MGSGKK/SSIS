CTEs Or Common Table Expressions
	These CTEs We Can Used to Implement Recursive Queries
Syntax:
[ WITH <common_table_expression> [ ,...n ] ]  
<common_table_expression>::=  
    expression_name [ ( column_name [ ,...n ] ) ]  
    AS  
    ( CTE_query_definition )  
	
DECLARE @StartNumber INT,@EndNumber INT
SELECT @StartNumber=1,@EndNumber=10000

;WITH CTE_GenerateSequence(Number)
AS
(
SELECT @StartNumber As Number
UNION ALL
SELECT Number+1 
FROM CTE_GenerateSequence
WHERE Number<@EndNumber
)
SELECT * FROM CTE_GenerateSequence  OPTION (MaxRecursion 10000)
