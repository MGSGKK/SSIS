Types Of Execution Plans in SQL Server?
	The SQL Server Execution Plan (Query Plan) Is a Set of Instructions that Describes Which Process Steps are Performed while a QUery is Executed by the Database Engine.
	1) Actual Execution Plans
		Actul Means It Will Show the Previous Run Execution Plan
	2) Estimated Execution Plans
		It Will Always Generate New Exceution Plan When You Execute the Stored Proc/InLine Querys.
Table Scan
		Table Scan Measn If Table Does Not Have Proper index the Table Scan Will Perform.
Index Scan 
	Index Scan Means It Will Scan the Data In Entire Index Page.
Index Seek
	Index Seek Means It Will Dirctly Go to The Index Page And It Pick The Record From Leaf Node.
Table
Index 
B-Tree
	
WHat Is Execution Plan In SQL Server

Clustered Index
	Simply Data Will Sort In Table
Non Clustered
	It Will Store the Data Separately
	B-Tree
	
Table Data it Will Store under Index Page
		Each Index Page -8KB
	
Index Scan means 
	That Entire index Page it Will Scan
	
Index Seek Means
	Instead of Entire Index Page it Will Dorectly Pick the Record from Index Page
	
	
Index Fragmentation
	if You Perform any DML (INSERT, Update,DELETE) Operation on Indexed Table By the Time It Can hold Some White SPace.

Based On Frgmnetation Percentage We have to Perform 2 Operations Respectively
	Index Rebuild
	Index Reorganize
	
If Index Fragmentation Is LessThan 30 and GretarThan 10 and PageCount Is Gretarthan 100 then We can Perform Index Reorganize

If Index Fragmentation Is  GretarThan 30 and Page Count GretarThan 100 We can Perform Index Rebuild

Physical Operation: These are the operators that implement the operation as directed by the logical operators. All the physical operators are usually object which perform an operation. Some examples are Clustered Index Scan, Index Seek etc.

Logical Operation: These operators describe the actual algebraic operation that is used to process the query. Examples are Right Anti Semi Join, Hash Join etc.

Actual Execution Mode: This is the actual execution mode that is used by the processing engine to execute the query. Examples â€“ Row and Batch

Estimated Execution Mode: This is similar to Actual Execution Mode but shows the estimated value

Storage: This tells us how the query optimizer will store the results that are being extracted by the query
Number of Rows Read: This returns the total number of records that are being read by the operator from the table index

Actual Number of Rows: This tells us the total number of records that have been returned based on the condition in the WHERE clause
Actual Number of Batches: If the execution mode for the query is a batch, then it will list the number of batches being executed to fetch the results

Estimated I/O Cost: This tells us the cost of the input/output operations of the result set

Estimated Operator Cost: This is not an actual cost but relative information with respect to the other operators in the execution plan

Estimated CPU Cost: The cost that the CPU will incur in order to process the operation

Estimated Subtree Cost: The cost of the execution tree that is being currently read from right-to-left and top-to-bottom

Number of Executions: This tells us about the number of executions that the optimizer can handle in a single batch

Estimated Number of Executions: This is also similar to the Number of Executions just the estimated value

Estimated Number of Rows: The number of rows that the optimizer thinks will be returned by the operator

Estimated Number of Rows to be Read: The number of rows that the optimizer thinks will be read by the operator

Estimated Row Size: The storage size each row in the operator

Actual Rebinds: This tells us about how many times the reevaluation of the object must be done in order to process the operator

Actual Rewinds: This property tells us if there were any changes in the correlated values for the object that is being processed

Ordered: This property determines if the dataset on which the operation is to be performed in a sorted state or not

Node ID: It is the automatic assignment of a number in the order in which the operator is called in the execution plan reading from right-to-left and top-to-bottom
