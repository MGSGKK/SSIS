Normalization:
	Normalization Means Eleminating Data Duplication and Creat the Dependency between tables. Thats Called Normalization.We Have 7 Different types of Normalisations Available.
Database Normal Forms
1NF (First Normal Form)
2NF (Second Normal Form)
3NF (Third Normal Form)
4NF (Fourth Normal Form)
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
5NF (Fifth Normal Form)
6NF (Sixth Normal Form)

1NF:
	Each table cell should contain a single value.
	Each record needs to be unique.
2NF:
	Rule 1- Be in 1NF
	Rule 2- Single Column Primary Key that does not functionally dependant on any subset of candidate key relation
3NF:
	Rule 1- Be in 2NF
	Rule 2- Has no transitive functional dependencies

	
Note:
	Every RDMBS System Like OLTP Systems It Should be In Upto 3rd/4Th Normalization.
	
	
Some Key Concepts
	What is a KEY in SQL?
	A KEY in SQL is a value used to identify records in a table uniquely. An SQL KEY is a single column or combination of multiple columns used to uniquely identify rows or tuples in the table. SQL Key is used to identify duplicate information, and it also helps establish a relationship between multiple tables in the database.

Note: Columns in a table that are NOT used to identify a record uniquely are called non-key columns.

What is Composite Key?
	A composite key is a primary key composed of multiple columns used to identify a record uniquely
