About Index Fragmentation In SQL Server?
	Index Fragmentation Means its Kind of White Space. When You Perform DML Operations On Table If That Table is Having Indexes By the Time This Index Fragmentation Will Occur.
	
SELECT S.name as 'Schema',
T.name as 'Table',
I.name as 'Index',
DDIPS.avg_fragmentation_in_percent,
DDIPS.page_count
FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats (DB_ID(), NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL) AS DDIPS
INNER JOIN sys.tables T on T.object_id = DDIPS.object_id
INNER JOIN sys.schemas S on T.schema_id = S.schema_id
INNER JOIN sys.indexes I ON I.object_id = DDIPS.object_id
AND DDIPS.index_id = I.index_id
WHERE DDIPS.database_id = DB_ID()
and I.name is not null
AND DDIPS.avg_fragmentation_in_percent > 0
ORDER BY DDIPS.avg_fragmentation_in_percent desc

How to Remove Index Fragmentation In SQL Server
	We Have 2 Methods to Remove Fragmentation Based On Fragmentation Percentage And Index Page Count
	
	A) Reorganize
		When Index Page Count Is Morethan 100 and Fragmentation Percentage Is More than 10 and Lessthan 30 We Can Use ReOrganize
	B) ReBuild
		When Index Page Count Is Morethan 100 and Fragmentation Percentage Is More than 30 We Can Use ReBuild
