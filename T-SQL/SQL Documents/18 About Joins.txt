Joins In SQL Server
	Joins are Used to Get the Reference From Other Tables Once You Joined tables
	
	We Have 6 Types Of Joins
	1) INNER JOIN /JOIN
		Inner Join Will Return Matching Reocrds From Both The Tables
	2) LEFT OUTER JOIN/ LEFT JOIN
		Left Join Will Retrun All the Records From Left Table and Matched Records From Right Table
	3) RIGHT OUTER JOIN /RIGHT JOIN
		Right Join Will Retrun All the Records From Right Table and Matched Records From Left Table
	4) FULL OUTER JOIN /FULL JOIN
		It Will Return the All Records From Both The Tables
	5) CROSS JOIN/CARTESIAN JOIN
		It Will Multiply the Records In Tables.
	6) SELF JOIN
		Self Join Its Kind Of Self Referential Integrity
		As Our Regular Joins ARe Used to Join Multiple Tables. But Self Used Join Table ItSelf.
Synatx For Joins 
FROM first_table < join_type > second_table [ ON ( join_condition ) ]
