Sub Querys In SQL Server
A subquery is the Inner Query as a query within a query. Subqueries enable you to write queries that select data rows for criteria that are actually developed while the query is executing at run time. More formally, it is the use of a SELECT statement inside one of the clauses of another SELECT statement.
Rules FOr Sub Queries:
Subqueries need to be enclosed in the Where clause and can be used with Insert, Update, Delete, and Select statements.
We can use comparison operators for example: <, >, > =, < =, !=, IN , Between for the subqueries.
The subquery is always executed first and then the main query.
Subquery should be enclosed within parentheses().
Subqueries are always to the right of the comparison operators.
We can’t use Order By clause in the subquery; instead, we can use the Group By clause.
We should use single-row operators with single-row subqueries and vice versa.
We can’t use Between clause with a subquery, but we can use Between in a subquery.

Types Of Subqueries
	We Have 3 types Of Subqueries
		A) Single Row Subquerie
			Inner Query It Should Return Single Value.
		B) MultiRow Subquerie
			Inner Query it Should Return Multiple Values
		C) Correlated Sub Query
			Correlated Sub Query Will Execute Independetly. Outer and Inner Both are Execute at a Time
